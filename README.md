📁 Dataset: Cleaned financials of 50 companies (manually prepared).

🧹 Data Preparation:

Cleaned and transformed raw dataset in Power BI (50 companies, 20+ financial columns)

Added custom calculated columns like Risk Buckets, Company Groups, and Growth Segments

📊 Dashboard Highlights (5 Key Sections):
✅ Executive Summary – Total revenue, income, top 10 companies
✅ Revenue vs Income Analysis – Understand profit efficiency
✅ Profitability & Valuation – Compare ROE, margins, and earnings
✅ Financial Risk (D/E) – Slicer-based filtering (Low, Moderate, High)
✅ Market Performance – EPS growth and stock return trends (YTD + Yearly)

🔍 Key Features:
Slicers by Risk Level and Company Groups (1–5)
KPI Cards for totals and averages
Bar, column, and scatter visuals to highlight insights
Conditional formatting to enhance financial comparisons
DAX logic using SWITCH, RANKX, and custom buckets

📈 What I Learned:
This project strengthened my data modeling, DAX calculations, and financial storytelling skills using Power BI. It taught me how to turn raw financial data into clear visual narratives that drive decision-making.

I'm happy to connect with fellow professionals in data analytics, BI, or financial domains – feedback and suggestions are always welcome! 🙌
